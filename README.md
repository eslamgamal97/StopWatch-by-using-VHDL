# StopWatch-by-using-VHDL

The digital stop watch which counts downwards. It has 4 inputs: clk, min, sec & start_stop. The first input (clk) is an input clock which is assumed to have frequency 1 Hz. The inputs min & sec is the inputs to define the minutes and seconds from which it will start counting from. The start_stop input is used to start or stop the stop- watch count. It has 3 outputs: min_out, sec_out & finish. The first two outputs is used to show the counting value the stop watch are counting while the last output (finish) is used to determine the finish of counting.

The user determines the required count the stop watch start with, through defining the 2 inputs min & sec. Then start the counting through the input start_stop. The stop watch starts to count down from these predefined values till reaching zero. When the counting reaches zero, the output (finish) will be logic ‘1’.
